The User Account Management system handles user registration, authentication, and role-based access control using Firebase Authentication and Firestore.
 Users can register as a Patron, Vendor, or NEA Officer. Upon login, the system verifies credentials securely through Firebase and retrieves the user’s role from the Firestore database.
 Based on the assigned role, users are automatically redirected to the appropriate dashboard. This ensures secure access control and proper separation of features across different user types.
