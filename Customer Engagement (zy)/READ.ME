Firebase / Firestore Integration

What Firebase is used for
- Firestore Database stores application data so it is:
  - shared across team members’ features (create order, vendor queue, tracking)
  - real-time synced (tracking updates immediately when vendor updates status)

Collections (example structure)
- orders/{orderId}
  - orderId, statusIndex, statusText, items, totals, createdAt, updatedAt, etc.
- stalls/{stallId}
  - stall info and optional nested items subcollection
- (Planned / Optional) reviews, complaints, likes, promos, loyalty
