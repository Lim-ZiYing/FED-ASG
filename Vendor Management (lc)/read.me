The Vendor Management system allows vendors to manage their stall and menu items through a dedicated dashboard.
Vendors can add new menu items by entering details such as item name, price, and cuisine type.
All data is stored in Firebase Firestore, ensuring persistent cloud-based storage rather than local storage.
Menu items are dynamically loaded from the database and can be updated or deleted as needed. 
This module demonstrates full integration with Firebase for real-time data handling and structured vendor operations.
